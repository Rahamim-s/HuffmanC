# How to use HuffmanC ? 
To be able to compress the text of your choice, you will need a .txt file which will contain the text to be downloaded.

This file must be stored in the same folder as the one containing our software.
You now launch the program by executing the .exe and you will see appear in the same folder two new .txt.

-The first named "textFinal" contains your text file converted to 0 and 1
-The second "texteFinal2" contains the decompression of "texteFinal"
